## Project Overview

Deployed a self-hosted n8n instance to run AI agent workflows and custom server integrations from my home server. This project involved setting up domain management, router network configuration, and dynamic DNS updates to ensure reliable external access.

### Features
- **Workflow Automation**: Create and manage complex workflows with a visual editor.
- **Custom Domain**: Access n8n via a custom domain with SSL/TLS security.
- **Docker Deployment**: Containerized setup for easy management and updates.
- **Port Forwarding**: Configured router to allow external access to n8n.
- **Cloudflare Integration**: Used Cloudflare for DNS management and security.

## What I Learned
- Gained experience with **n8n** for workflow automation and external integration.
- Configured **port forwarding** and router configuration for home networks.
- Integrated **Cloudflare** for DNS management and security.
- Understood the challenges of **dynamic IP handling** and automated updates.
