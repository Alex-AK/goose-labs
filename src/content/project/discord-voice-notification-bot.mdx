## Project Overview

A privacy-first, lightweight Discord bot that sends notifications when users join or leave voice channels. Built with TypeScript and designed for self-hosting with only essential dependencies. This bot is perfect for small communities looking to create a casual, low-pressure environment for spontaneous voice chats.

### Features

- **Smart Notifications:** Sends join/leave notifications with configurable delays to prevent spam.
- **Privacy-First:** No external tracking, databases, or user data storage.
- **Configurable:** Separate channels for join/leave, customizable timing, logging levels.
- **Production Ready:** Health monitoring, graceful shutdown, notification retry mechanism, server logging.
- **Built-in Monitoring:** Discord slash command for bot status and server statistics.
- **HTTP Health Endpoint:** RESTful health check endpoint for uptime monitoring and external health checks.
- **Modern Architecture:** TypeScript, modular design, comprehensive error handling.
- **Self-Hosting:** Deploy anywhere - no external services required.

## What I Learned

- Leveraged **Discord.js** to listen for voice state events and send notifications.
- Set up a Discord bot from scratch, including **authorization scopes** for bot access and permissions management.
- Implemented **bot commands** to check runtime status and uptime for monitoring and debugging.
- Deployed the bot to a **self-hosted Coolify instance**, enabling zero-downtime deployments and updates.
- Learned how to structure and maintain a **fully open-source project** with documentation for others to deploy, modify, or contribute.
