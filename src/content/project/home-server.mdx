## Project Overview

Set up a self-hosted home server running **Ubuntu Server** with **Coolify** to manage and deploy containerized applications. This project was part of a broader goal to explore self-hosting, simplify development workflows, and create a personal playground for automation and experimentation.

### Features

- **Ubuntu Server Deployment**: Installed a clean, minimal Linux environment optimized for headless operation.
- **Coolify Platform**: Self-hosted PaaS for managing Docker-based applications with a slick UI.
- **Service Ecosystem**: Deployed over 10 internal services including `n8n`, `ollama`, `Dozzle`, `Portainer`, and more.
- **Local Network Access**: All apps accessible over local IP; internal dashboard for centralized access.
- **Modular Hardware Setup**: Chose cost-effective, small form factor PC for low-power, 24/7 operation.

## What I Learned

- Evaluated and selected **home server hardware** with goals of low cost, minimal setup, and long-term flexibility.
- Learned how to **wipe and install Ubuntu Server** from scratch, including partitioning and SSH setup.
- Explored various **self-hosting platforms**, ultimately selecting Coolify for its balance of control and simplicity.
- Gained hands-on experience deploying and managing **Docker containers** with persistent storage and automatic restarts.
- Built a growing **library of self-hosted tools**, each serving a niche in automation, observability, and infrastructure control.
